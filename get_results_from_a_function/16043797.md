How do I pass variables across functions?

----

I want to pass values (as variables) between different functions. 

For example, I assign values to a list in one function, then I want to use that list in another function:

    list = []

    def defineAList():
        list = ['1','2','3']
        print "For checking purposes: in defineAList, list is",list
        return list

    def useTheList(list):
        print "For checking purposes: in useTheList, list is",list

    def main():
        defineAList()
        useTheList(list)

    main()

I would expect this to do as follows:

1. Initialize 'list' as an empty list; call main (this, at least, I know I've got right...)
2. Within defineAList(), assign certain values into the list; then pass the new list back into main() 
3. Within main(), call useTheList(list)
4. Since 'list' is included in the parameters of the useTheList function, I would expect that useTheList would now use the list as defined by defineAList(), NOT the empty list defined before calling main.

However, my output is:
    
    For checking purposes: in defineAList, list is ['1', '2', '3']
    For checking purposes: in useTheList, list is []

"return" does not do what I expected. What does it actually do? How do I take the list from defineAList() and use it within useTheList()?

I don't want to use global variables.
