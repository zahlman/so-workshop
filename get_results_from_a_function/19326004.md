Access a function variable outside the function without using "global"

----

I am trying to access a local function variable outside the function in Python.

I can make code like this work with global variables:
```
bye = ''
def hi():
    global bye
    bye = 5
    sigh = 10

hi()
print(bye)
```
Next, I tried this code, hoping to access `bye` outside `hi()` without using `global bye`:
```
def hi():
    bye = 5 
    sigh = 10
    return

hi()
x = hi()
print(x.bye)
```
This gives `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'bye'`.

Next, I tried:
```
def hi():
    bye = 5
    sigh = 10
    return bye

hi()
x = hi()
print(x.bye)
```
This didn't improve matters; I get `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'bye'`.

Is there a way to access a local function variable (`bye`) outside its function (`hi()`) without using globals and also without printing out the `sigh` variable? How can I do it?
