Recently I started playing around with Python and I came around something peculiar in the way closures work. Consider the following code:

    adders=[None, None, None, None]

    for i in [0,1,2,3]:
       adders[i]=lambda a: i+a

    print adders[1](3)

It builds a simple array of functions that take a single input and return that input added by a number. The functions are constructed in `for` loop where the iterator `i` runs from `0` to `3`. For each of these numbers a `lambda` function is created which captures `i` and adds it to the function's input. The last line calls the second `lambda` function with `3` as a parameter. To my surprise the output was `6`.

I expected a `4`. My reasoning was: in Python everything is an object and thus every variable is essential a pointer to it. When creating the `lambda` closures for `i`, I expected it to store a pointer to the integer object currently pointed to by `i`. That means that when `i` assigned a new integer object it shouldn't effect the previously created closures. Sadly, inspecting the `adders` array within a debugger shows that it does. All `lambda` functions refer to the last value of `i`, `3`, which results in `adders[1](3)` returning `6`.

Which make me wonder about the following:

 - What do the closures capture exactly?
 - What is the most elegant way to convince the `lambda` functions to capture the current value of `i` in a way that will not be affected when `i` changes its value?
