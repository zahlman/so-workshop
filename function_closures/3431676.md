Creating functions in a loop

----

I'm trying to create functions inside of a loop:

    functions = []
    
    for i in range(3):
        def f():
            return i

        # alternatively: f = lambda: i
    
        functions.append(f)

The problem is that all functions end up being the same. Instead of returning 0, 1, and 2, all three functions return 2:

    print([f() for f in functions])
    # expected output: [0, 1, 2]
    # actual output:   [2, 2, 2]

Why is this happening, and what should I do to get 3 different functions that output 0, 1, and 2 respectively?
