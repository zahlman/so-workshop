I want to create a list of lambda objects from a list of constants in Python; for instance:

    listOfNumbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
    square = lambda x: x * x
    listOfLambdas = [lambda: square(i) for i in listOfNumbers]

This will create a list of lambda objects, however, when I run them:

    for f in listOfLambdas:
        print f(),

I would expect that it would print

    1 4 9 16 25

Instead, it prints:

    25 25 25 25 25

It seems as though the lambdas have all been given the wrong parameter. Have I done something wrong, and is there a way to fix it? I'm in Python 2.4 I think.

EDIT: a bit more of trying things and such came up with this:

    listOfLambdas = []
    for num in listOfNumbers:
        action = lambda: square(num)
        listOfLambdas.append(action)
        print action()

Prints the expected squares from 1 to 25, but then using the earlier print statement:

    for f in listOfLambdas:
        print f(),

still gives me all `25`s. How did the existing lambda objects change between those two print calls?
