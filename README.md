This repository is used to workshop canonical questions for Stack Overflow, particularly for Python questions.

Each folder represents a separate "question workshop". The initial contents are:

* The general topic that will be addressed by the canonical is explained and discussed in `discussion.md`
* For canonicals that are being written from scratch, `proposed.md` will contain my first draft
* For canonicals where an existing question will likely be chosen and improved, each prominent candidate will be included as a `.md` file identified by the original Stack Overflow question number.
