Writelines writes lines without newline, Just fills the file

----

I have a program that writes a list to a file. 
The list is a list of pipe delimited lines and the lines should be written to the file like this:

    123|GSV|Weather_Mean|hello|joe|43.45
    122|GEV|temp_Mean|hello|joe|23.45
    124|GSI|Weather_Mean|hello|Mike|47.45

BUT it wrote them line this ahhhh:

    123|GSV|Weather_Mean|hello|joe|43.45122|GEV|temp_Mean|hello|joe|23.45124|GSI|Weather_Mean|hello|Mike|47.45

This program wrote all the lines into like one line without any line breaks.. This hurts me a lot and I gotta figure-out how to reverse this but anyway, where is my program wrong here? I thought write lines should write lines down the file rather than just write everything to one line..

    fr = open(sys.argv[1], 'r') # source file
    fw = open(sys.argv[2]+"/masked_"+sys.argv[1], 'w') # Target Directory Location
    
    for line in fr:
        line = line.strip()
        if line == "":
            continue
        columns = line.strip().split('|')
        if columns[0].find("@") > 1:
            looking_for = columns[0] # this is what we need to search
        else:
            looking_for = "Dummy@dummy.com"
        if looking_for in d:
            # by default, iterating over a dictionary will return keys
                new_line = d[looking_for]+'|'+'|'.join(columns[1:])
                line_list.append(new_line)
        else:
            new_idx = str(len(d)+1)
            d[looking_for] = new_idx
            kv = open(sys.argv[3], 'a')
            kv.write(looking_for+" "+new_idx+'\n')
            kv.close()
            new_line = d[looking_for]+'|'+'|'.join(columns[1:])
            line_list.append(new_line)
    fw.writelines(line_list)
